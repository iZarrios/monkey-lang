### What is this?
This is my follow through of [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)

I have always wanted to know how does one implement a programming language from scratch and this book did exactly that. It was a great read overall.

### Things that I found fascinating
- [Pratt parsing](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html)
- How did we go from goland to monkeyland (you can miss it easily if you are not careful).
